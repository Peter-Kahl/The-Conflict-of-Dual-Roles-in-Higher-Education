### Abstract

This paper addresses a critical yet under-examined structural conflict in higher education governance: the dual roles educators increasingly hold as both epistemic fiduciaries and institutional administrators. While critiques of managerialism in academia are widespread, I contribute uniquely by asserting that these dual roles inherently compromise educators’ fiduciary duties—loyalty, care, and epistemic integrity—to students and disciplines. Drawing systematically upon fiduciary ethics (Smith, Miller), institutional theory (Barnett), and epistemic justice scholarship (Fricker, Anderson, Medina), I argue that educators’ managerial roles create irreconcilable conflicts of interest. My original contribution extends beyond diagnosis by offering concrete institutional solutions, including clearly defined role boundaries, independent governance structures, fiduciary ethics training, and regular fiduciary audits. Ultimately, I demonstrate that structural separation is ethically imperative and institutionally feasible, necessary to protect the epistemic integrity, fiduciary accountability, and public trust essential for the future of higher education.
